dnsRedir
========

XXX in development.  pre-alpha.

dnsRedir is a small DNS server that will respond to certain
queries with addresses provided on the command line. All other
queries will be proxied to a "real" name server. This program
can be used to easily redirect a few domain names to 
addresses for the purpose of security and protocol testing.
